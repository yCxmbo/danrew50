# Inspired-by Portfolio Starter (GitHub Pages)

A clean, single-page portfolio with sections for hero, education, software, skills, work, experience, journey, and contact. Built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS and ready for GitHub Pages.

## Quick Start
1. Create a **public** repo named `yourusername.github.io` on GitHub.
2. Upload these files to the repo root.
3. In **Settings â†’ Pages**, publish from the `main` branch.
4. Visit `https://yourusername.github.io`.

## Customize
- Edit `index.html` section text, dates, and links.
- Replace images in `/images` with your work (SVGs included as placeholders).
- Update the contact form `action` with your Formspree endpoint, or delete the form and use `mailto:` only.
- Adjust colors in `css/styles.css` (tokens at the top).
