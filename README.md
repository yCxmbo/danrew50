# Aurora Portfolio â€” GitHub Pages Template (Original)

A fresh, original one-page portfolio template with hero, selected work (modal gallery), experience timeline, about, and contact. Built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. Dark by default with a light-mode toggle.

## Quick Start
1. Create a **public** repo named `yourusername.github.io` on GitHub.
2. Upload everything in this folder (keep `.nojekyll` in root).
3. In **Settings â†’ Pages**, publish from the `main` branch.
4. Visit `https://yourusername.github.io`.

## Customize
- Edit `index.html`: name, email, copy for each section, experience dates.
- Replace images in `/images` with your own work; update `src` attributes if names change.
- Update social links in the Contact section.
- Tweak colors/spacing via CSS variables at the top of `css/styles.css`.
- Replace `images/cover.png` for social sharing previews.

Enjoy! ðŸš€
