# GitHub Pages Portfolio — NMC-inspired Template

Clean, single-page designer portfolio template inspired by the aesthetic/layout of nathanmccracken.com (no copied code). Ready for **GitHub Pages**.

## Quick Start
1. Create a public repo named `yourusername.github.io` on GitHub.
2. Upload all files from this folder (keep `.nojekyll` in the root).
3. In **Settings → Pages**, publish from the `main` branch.
4. Your site: `https://yourusername.github.io`.

## Customize
- Edit `index.html`: name, email, text in each section, experience dates, project titles.
- Replace images in `/images` with your own work (keep names or update the `src` in HTML).
- Update social links in the Contact section.
- Colors/spacing are at the top of `css/styles.css` as CSS variables.
- Optional: replace `images/cover.png` for social sharing previews.

## Notes
- Accessible: skip link, high-contrast defaults, keyboard-friendly modals.
- Performance: no frameworks; just HTML/CSS/JS.
- Theme: dark by default with a light-mode toggle (persisted).
